It all started back in the Covid when everything was on the verge of halt. Businesses and schools were making efforts to go online and deliver services over the internet. It was right at that moment, when Edgenuity, an e-learning resource, became a popular channel of education - but it came out to be the WORST platform ever!

In today's world, distance learning is considered to be a bonus point for students. However, despite its list of benefits, the absence of teacher-student interaction in real time brings a major setback in learning. No doubt, it is convenient to learn at home, but when it comes to struggling with difficult concepts, Edgenuity fails to provide a viable solution.

The grading system of Edgenuity is exercised by an algorithm that searches for keywords - not real teachers who manually grade a writing assignment. Every student needs attention at an individual level, you can’t generalize a teaching methodology, and assume it to work for every student. It doesn’t work that way. So, in order to make things easier with Edgenuity, we’ve got you a perfect Edgenuity hack - more on that later in this article.
What is Edgenuity?
The company was founded in 1998 and it wasn’t built during the pandemic, which most people believe in. Today, more than 20,000 schools nationwide are relying on Edgenuity. The platform allows students to complete lessons virtually, without the need for in-person instructions, and complete self-paced courses. While this provides much convenience to the students, it also comes with a list of major challenges.

Edgenuity, unlike traditional classrooms where students may ask questions and receive quick feedback from their instructors, assesses and provides feedback to students using algorithms. While this is useful for identifying areas where students want extra assistance, it may limit opportunities for deeper understanding and engagement.

The platform provides study material in the form of pre-recorded video lessons, quizzes, and assignments. In this process, teachers don’t interact with or instruct the students in real time but rather track the progress/performance through the platform’s algorithm.

Edgenuity does have some advantages over the classroom but since it’s completely based on algorithms, it leads to more significant drawbacks. One of the key advantages of Edgenuity is that it provides flexibility to the students to learn according to their own schedules. However, numerous objections raised by parents nationwide highlight how it’s impacting the students in the learning process.
Challenges of Learning Without Real Teachers
With no teacher-student interactive sessions, the students find it difficult to perform better with Edgenuity. Here are some of the major challenges that students face without engaging with teachers.

1.	Outdated Information:

Online public forums are spammed with the threads of parents discussing how outdated information is residing on Edgenuity. For instance, a mother was complaining how Edgenuity marked her son’s quiz as to be wrong since it was referencing Windows 7 to be the latest version of Windows OS.

Such challenges are quite common among platforms that are not regularly updated. Let’s see what other challenges students have to face when there’s no real teachers involved in the learning process, and most importantly, how it impacts their parents' mental wellbeing.

2.	Lack of Personal Attention:

Every student deserves attention at an individual level. Teachers have to come up with a customized teaching methodology that works for almost every student. The problem with online e-learning platforms is that they go with a generalized strategy of teaching which impedes active learning among young students.

3.	Lack of Contextual Understanding:

While studying a concept in class, a teacher explains it with a context so students can relate to it and understand it better. But in Edgenuity, pre-recorded lectures can often be so isolated that students fail to grasp the true meaning of the concepts.
